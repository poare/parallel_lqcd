# parallel_lqcd
Julia code for parallelizing lattice QCD code. Some papers to check out that I think will be helpful (all in the Dropbox):
- [High-Performance Parallelism Pearls Chapter 9](https://github.com/poare/parallel_lqcd/blob/main/Chapter-9---Wilson-Dslash-Kernel-From-Lattice_2015_High-Performance-Parallel.pdf)
- [High-Performance Lattice QCD for Multi-core Based Parallel Systems Using a Cache-Friendly Hybrid Threaded-MPI Approach](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6114421)

### What is implemented so far?
- src/actions/actions.jl: General framework for implementing actions.
  - We can use the Actions.FermiActionParam_Wilson
- src/fermions/AbstractFermion.jl
  - This is the abstract parent class of all fermions, and is worth taking a look at.
  - Two classes of interest: ```AbstractFermion```, and ```FermionFields```.
    - AbstractFermion is a superclass of all Fermion types, and we'll need it to make Wilson Fermions
    - Not sure about the implementation of FermionFields, but this is what ψ(x) will need to be.
- src/fermions/WilsonFermion.jl
  - This is a subtype ```WilsonFermion <: FermionFields```, so it's a field for a Wilson fermion.
  - I believe **either Wx!(...) or Dx!(...)** is the implementation of the Dirac operator: I'm not yet sure which one it is though.
  - Also a lot of extra functionality for multiplying Dirac fermions by γ matrices.
- src/gaugefields/gaugefields.jl
  - TODO check this out

### What do we need to implement?
- Extra data structures, like:
  - ```ParWilsonFermion <: WilsonFermion```: Our WilsonFermion module to use for this project, this is where we can add extra functionality that we want
  - ```HalfSpinor```: upper two components of a spinor field. Can also have this be absorbed into ```ParWilsonFermion```.
  - ```ParWilsonAction```: Multithreaded Wilson action.
  - ```MPIWilsonAction```: Distributed Wilson action using MPI. Will likely need separate run scripts as well.
- Blocking (?)

### Steps:
1. Implement the Wilson-clover action in serial using LatticeQCD.jl datastructures.
2. Multithread the Wilson-clover action

### Random comments and notes
- To load a module, it's not as simple as just writing ```using LatticeQCD```. Let's say we want to use some functionality from the Actions module. We can either import it by selecting the functions we want to use, and using them, like so:
  ```
  using LatticeQCD.Actions:FermiActionParam_Wilson
  FermiActionParam_Wilson(...parameters...)
  ```
  or we can load the entire namespace ```Actions``` into our file, and use the keyword to access the contents of the module:
  ```
  using LatticeQCD.Actions:Actions
  Actions.FermiActionParam_Wilson(...parameters...)
  ```
- The notation ```Array{T,1}``` is just an array with 1 dimension, i.e. a ```Vector{T}```.
- A ```view``` of an Array gives a specific subset / slicing of the array, but allows the user to modify the original array by modifying the view. This is different than just slicing the array, i.e. ```A[2, :]```, because slicing the array gives a **copy** of the original array, while ```@view A[2, :]``` allows you to modify the original array by modifying the view object.
